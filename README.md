```sh
npm run preview
```

## Iterations

### Iteration 0: Getting started

Created new Vue project with `npm create vue:latest`.

### Iteration 1: Static content

Made static product page from mock work as a Vue project:

- Source: category.html from static project
- Logo and CSS go into assets folder
- index.html: link CSS and bootstrap JS
- App.vue: Main content goes here. Logo image link adapted.

### Iteration 2: GitHub Page deployment

- Added `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.js.yml` to deploy as GitHub Page.
- Tweaked `vite.config.js` to use correct base URL - otherwise the JS files won't be loaded when hosted as a GitHub page.
- Added custom favicon

### Iteration 3: Dynamic product loading from local data

- Replaced static product cards with dynamic rendering using Vue's `v-for` from local `products` array in data.js.
- Products are displayed in a grid.
- "Details" button shows product description in an alert.
- Product images, titles, and prices are now populated from array data.

### Iteration 4: High-Level components

- Vue components have been created inside `src/components`.
- `ProductCard.vue` is used inside `App.vue` for showing a product summary.
- `App.vue` is now using `SpecialBanner.vue`, `Navbar.vue`, and `Footer.vue` components for better structure.
- Styles specific to components have been moved from `style.css` into their respective `<style scoped>` sections.
- Logic specific to components has been moved into their respective `<script setup>` sections.

### Iteration 5: Low-Level components

- Introduced some low-level reusable components:
  - `Button.vue`: A reusable button component with different variants (accent, secondary).
  - `FooterLink.vue`: A link component specifically for footer links (styled appropriately).

### Iteration 6: Added Vue-Router and product detail view

- Integrated Vue-Router as preparation to adding different views (`router/index.js`)
  - Important note: When hosting the app not under / on the server (as we are doing with GitHub Pages), `createWebHistory` must be provided with the app path!
  - also `main.js` must be imported relatively
- Updated `App.vue` to include `<router-view>` for rendering routed components.
- Created route `/` to `ProductCatalog.vue` for the product listing page
- Added a new product detail view that is linked from `ProductCard.vue` and can be accessed via `/product/:id`.

### Iteration 7: State management with Pinia

- Integrated Pinia for simple global state (banner visibility is saved through different views) and updated the banner component to use the store:
  - Installed Pinia: `npm install pinia`.
  - Added a small store: `src/stores/banner.js` (defines `isVisible` and `hideBanner()`).
  - Registered Pinia in `src/main.js` with `createPinia()` and `app.use(pinia)`.
  - Updated `SpecialBanner.vue` to use `useBannerStore()` and call `hideBanner` on button click.
- Note: For persistence across reloads you can extend the store to sync with `localStorage` or use a pinia plugin.

### Iteration 8: Dynamic product loading via REST

- Replaced static product data with data from REST endpoints.
- Adapted `ProductCard.vue` and `ProductDetail.vue` accordingly.
- Only very basic error handling is implemented.

### Iteration 9: Complete CRUD of products via REST

- Added a `CreateProduct` view to allow users to create new products via a form.
  - Simple implementation with JS alerts for success/error handling.
- Added an `EditProduct` view to allow users to edit or delete existing products.
  - Simple implementation with JS alerts for success/error handling.
- Integrated API calls for creating, updating, and deleting products:
  - **Create**: Sends a `POST` request to `/api/product`.
  - **Update**: Sends a `PUT` request to `/api/product/:id`.
  - **Delete**: Sends a `DELETE` request to `/api/product/:id`.
- Updated the `ProductCatalog` view to include a "Neues Produkt" button to navigate to the `CreateProduct` view.
- Updated the `ProductCard` component to include a "Bearbeiten" button to navigate to the `EditProduct` view.

### Iteration 10: Product Search and Filter

- Added `ProductFilter.vue` component for filtering products by name and category.
  - Fetches available categories and their translations from the backend (`/api/category`).
  - Emits search parameters to the parent component.
- Updated `ProductCatalog.vue` to handle search and filter events.
  - `fetchProducts` now accepts filter parameters and appends them to the API request (`/api/product?name=...&category=...`).
- Also updated dependencies in `package.json`

### Iteration 11: Product Reviews (1:n)

- Integrated product reviews into the frontend
  - Product - Review is a 1:n relationship 
- Added `ProductReviews.vue` component to fetch and display reviews for a specific product.
  - Creation and deletion of reviews is currently not supported.
- Updated `ProductDetail.vue` to include the `ProductReviews` component.

### Iteration 12: API base URL configuration via `.env` files

- Introduced `.env.development` and `.env.production` files to manage environment-specific variable for the API base URL.
- Updated API calls to use `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL` instead of hardcoded URLs, see e.g. `ProductDetail.vue`
- This allows easy switching between development (local) and production backends.
