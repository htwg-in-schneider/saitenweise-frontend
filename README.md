## Iterations

### Iteration 0: Getting started

Created new Vue project with `npm create vue:latest`.

### Iteration 1: Static content

Made static product page from mock work as a Vue project:

- Logo and CSS go into assets folder
- index.html: link CSS and bootstrap JS
- App.vue: Main content goes here. Logo image link adapted.
